## Comments
I think the media query part was not difficult, but I realized after the fact that I had not created the desktop-first branch off of the v0.1 tag. I couldn't figure out how to go back and fix that without starting all over again. After starting over, I was rushing and made some mistakes, so the whole thing took longer than it should have.  :unamused:
